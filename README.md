This action publishes your Chrome extension to [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/) using the [Chrome Web Store API v1.1](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/api_index/#items).

This action can only publish new version of an existing extension. Publishing new extension is not supported.

## Prepare

Following items are required before publishing your Chrome extension:

- A zip file to be uploaded.
- An API client ID and secret.
- A refresh token.

Please refer to this [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/using_webstore_api/) for how to generate API keys and refresh token.

## Usage

Unless otherwise noted with default value, all options are required.

- `extension-id`: the id of your extension; can be referred from the url of your extension page on the Web Store.
- `zip-path`: path to the zip file built in the previous steps.
- `tester-only`: (boolean) `true` indicates publishing to testers only; default `false`.
- `upload-only`: (boolean) `true` indicates this extension will be uploaded without publishing (you'll have to publish it manually); default `false`.
- `client-id`: your API client ID.
- `client-secret`: your API client secret.
- `refresh-token`: your refresh token.

Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: wdzeng/chrome-extension@v1
    with:
      extension-id: your-extension-id
      zip-path: your-extension.zip
      tester-only: false
      client-id: ${{ secrets.CHROME_CLIENT_ID }}
      client-secret: ${{ secrets.CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET }}
      refresh-token: ${{ secrets.CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
```
